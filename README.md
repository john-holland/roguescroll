#[Rogue Scroll](https://roguescroll-john-holland.c9.io/ "In development, it may not always be on... or working")

The Rogue Scroll is a mythical scroll which grants the reader power over all things for a limited time.

The Rogue Scroll resides at the bottom of a shifting tomb and only shows itself to those who do not expect it.

After the Rogue Scroll bestows its boon, it unleashes powerful magic - reconfiguring the layout and location of its devious tomb.

Those brave enough to enter and conquer the tomb will need to be especially brave to pit their skills, brains or brawn against the Rogue Scroll's guardian!

##Todo:

Provide an option for using https://github.com/marcoceppi/bootstrap-glyphicons, refactor glyphicon-renderer

* broken #game div gets deleted or shrunk by mischievous gremlins presumably idk
  * hide-at-start doesn't seem likely
  * templating order maybe? check diff?
  * scroll-container doesn't have any associated html renderer so i don't think it's that
* bork bork bork - some dog
* es6 module conversion
  * +typescript module conversion
* add excelsior
* final boss
* level height and scroll height detection
* options doesn't seem to work? i probably disabled it, but iirc i was working on it when i left off
