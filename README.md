#Rogue Scroll

The Rogue Scroll is a mythical scroll which grants the reader power over all things for a limited time.

The Rogue Scroll resides at the bottom of a shifting tomb and only shows itself to those who do not expect it.

After the Rogue Scroll bestows its boon, it unleashes powerful magic - reconfiguring the layout and location of its devious tomb.

Those brave enough to enter and conquer the tomb will need to be especially brave to pit their skills, brains or brawn against the Rogue Scroll's guardian!
